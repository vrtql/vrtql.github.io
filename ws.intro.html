library written in C. It provides a simple yet flexible API for building
WebSocket clients and supports all standard WebSocket features including text
and binary messages, ping/pong frames, control frames and includes built-in
OpenSSL support.</p><p>The motivation behind the project is to have a portable WebSockets client
library under a permissive license (MIT) which feels like a traditional socket
API (blocking with optional timeout) which can also provide a foundation for
some additional messaging features similar to (but lighter weight than) AMQP and
MQTT.</p><p>As a client-side library, connections are blocking with optional
timeout. The API is threadsafe in so far as each connection must be maintained
in its own thread. All global structures and common services (error-reporting
and tracing) use thread-local variables.</p><p>The code compiles and runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OS X,
Illumos/Solaris and Windows. It is fully commented and well-documented.
Furthermore, the code is under a permissive license (MIT) allowing its use in
commercial (closed-source) applications. The build system (CMake) includes
built-in support to for cross-compiling from Linux/BSD to Windows, provided
MinGW compiler and tools are installed on the host system. Instructions on
cross-compiling are covered in <a class="xref" href="ws.build.windows.html" title="2. Cross-Compiling">Section 2, “Cross-Compiling”</a>.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ws.intro.ws"></a>1. WebSocket Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>WebSockets significantly enhance the capabilities of web applications
compared to standard HTTP or raw TCP connections. They enable real-time data
exchange with reduced latency due to the persistent connection, making them
ideal for applications like live chat, gaming, real-time trading, and live
sports updates.</p><p>Several large-scale applications and platforms utilize WebSockets today,
including Slack, WhatsApp, and Facebook for real-time messaging. WebSockets are
also integral to the functionality of collaborative coding platforms like
Microsoft's Visual Studio Code Live Share. On the server-side, many popular
software systems support WebSocket, including Node.js, Apache, and Nginx.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ws.overview.ws.bg"></a>1.1. Background</h3></div></div></div><p>Websockets emerged in the late 2000s in response to the growing need for
real-time, bidirectional communication in web applications. The goal was to
provide a standardized way for web servers to send content to browsers without
being prompted by the user, and vice versa. In December 2011 they were
standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 6455. They now
enjoy wide support and integration in modern browsers, smartphones, IoT devices
and server software. They have become a fundamental technology in modern web
applications.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ws.overview.concepts"></a>1.2. Concepts and Operation</h3></div></div></div><p>Unlike traditional HTTP connections, which are stateless and
unidirectional, WebSocket connections are stateful and bidirectional. The
connection is established through an HTTP handshake (HTTP Upgrade request),
which is then upgraded to a WebSocket connection if the server supports it. The
connection remains open until explicitly closed, enabling low-latency data
exchange.</p><p>The WebSocket protocol communicates through a series of data units called
frames. Each WebSocket frame has a maximum size of 2^64 bytes (but the actual
size limit may be smaller due to network or system constraints). There are
several types of frames, including text frames, binary frames, continuation
frames, and control frames.</p><p>Text frames contain Unicode text data, while binary frames carry binary
data. Continuation frames allow for larger messages to be broken down into
smaller chunks. Control frames handle protocol-level interactions and include
close frames, ping frames, and pong frames. The close frame is used to terminate
a connection, ping frames are for checking the liveness of the connection, and
pong frames are responses to ping frames.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer" class="navtable"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ws.preface.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ws.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ws.build.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Foreward </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="ws.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Building and Installing</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
