 * Reads a string into the given buffer, ensures it is a valid UTF-8 string
 * without NUL characters, and adds a null-terminator at the end.
 *
 * This does not accept any UTF-8 variant such as Modified UTF-8, CESU-8 or
 * WTF-8. Only pure UTF-8 is allowed, but without the NUL character, since
 * it cannot be represented in a null-terminated string.
 *
 * Raises mpack_error_too_big if there is not enough room for the string and null-terminator.
 * Raises mpack_error_type if the value is not a string or is not a valid UTF-8 string.
