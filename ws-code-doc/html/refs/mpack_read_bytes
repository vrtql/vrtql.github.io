 * Reads bytes from a string, binary blob or extension object, copying
 * them into the given buffer.
 *
 * A str, bin or ext must have been opened by a call to mpack_read_tag()
 * which yielded one of these types, or by a call to an expect function
 * such as mpack_expect_str() or mpack_expect_bin().
 *
 * If an error occurs, the buffer contents are undefined.
 *
 * This can be called multiple times for a single str, bin or ext
 * to read the data in chunks. The total data read must add up
 * to the size of the object.
 *
 * @param reader The MPack reader
 * @param p The buffer in which to copy the bytes
 * @param count The number of bytes to read
