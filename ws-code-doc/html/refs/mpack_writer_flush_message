<doc f='codebrowser/src/mpack/mpack-writer.h' l='459'>/**
 * Flushes any buffered data to the underlying stream.
 *
 * If the writer is connected to a socket and you are keeping it open,
 * you will want to call this after writing a message (or set of
 * messages) so that the data is actually sent.
 *
 * It is not necessary to call this if you are not keeping the writer
 * open afterwards. You can just call `mpack_writer_destroy()` and it
 * will flush before cleaning up.
 *
 * This will assert if no flush function is assigned to the writer.
 *
 * If write tracking is enabled, this will break and flag @ref
 * mpack_error_bug if the writer has any open compound types, ensuring
 * that no compound types are still open. This prevents a &quot;missing
 * finish&quot; bug from causing a never-ending message.
