 * Writes a null-terminated string, or a nil node if the given cstr pointer
 * is NULL. (The null-terminator is not written.)
 *
 * MPack does not care about the underlying encoding, but UTF-8 is highly
 * recommended, especially for compatibility with JSON. You should consider
 * calling mpack_write_utf8_cstr_or_nil() instead, especially if you will
 * be reading it back as UTF-8.
 *
 * You should not call mpack_finish_str() after calling this; this
 * performs both start and finish.
