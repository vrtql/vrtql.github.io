 * Reads a string into the given buffer, ensuring it is a valid UTF-8 string
 * and returning its size in bytes.
 *
 * This does not add a null-terminator! Use mpack_expect_utf8_cstr() to
 * add a null-terminator.
 *
 * This does not accept any UTF-8 variant such as Modified UTF-8, CESU-8 or
 * WTF-8. Only pure UTF-8 is allowed.
 *
 * NUL bytes are allowed in the string (as they are in UTF-8.)
 *
 * Raises mpack_error_too_big if there is not enough room for the string.
 * Raises mpack_error_type if the value is not a string or is not a valid UTF-8 string.
