 * Initializes an MPack writer that writes to a libc FILE. This can be used to
 * write to stdout or stderr, or to a file opened separately.
 *
 * @param writer The MPack writer.
 * @param stdfile The FILE.
 * @param close_when_done If true, fclose() will be called on the FILE when it
 *         is no longer needed. If false, the file will not be flushed or
 *         closed when writing is done.
 *
 * @note The writer is buffered. If you want to write other data to the FILE in
 *         between messages, you must flush it first.
