 * COMPLEMENTOF* definitions. These identifiers are used to (de-select)
 * ciphers normally not being used.
 * Example: &quot;RC4&quot; will activate all ciphers using RC4 including ciphers
 * without authentication, which would normally disabled by DEFAULT (due
 * the &quot;!ADH&quot; being part of default). Therefore &quot;RC4:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT&quot;
 * will make sure that it is also disabled in the specific selection.
 * COMPLEMENTOF* identifiers are portable between version, as adjustments
 * to the default cipher setup will also be included here.
 *
 * COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT does not experience the same special treatment that
 * DEFAULT gets, as only selection is being done and no sorting as needed
 * for DEFAULT.
