 * @hideinitializer
 *
 * Reads a nil node or the start of an array and allocates storage for it,
 * placing its size in out_count. A number of objects follow equal to the element
 * count of the array if a non-empty array was read.
 *
 * If an error occurs, NULL is returned and the reader is placed in an
 * error state.
 *
 * If a nil node was read, NULL is returned. If an empty array was read,
 * mpack_done_array() is called automatically and NULL is returned. These
 * do not indicate error. You should not check the return value for NULL
 * to check for errors; only check the reader&apos;s error state.
 *
 * The allocated array must be freed with MPACK_FREE() (or simply free()
 * if MPack&apos;s allocator hasn&apos;t been customized.)
 *
 * @warning You must call @ref mpack_done_array() if and only if a non-zero
 * element count is read. This function does not differentiate between nil
 * and an empty array.
 *
 * @throws mpack_error_type if the value is not an array or if its size is
 * greater than max_count.
