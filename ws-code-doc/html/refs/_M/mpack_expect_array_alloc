 * @hideinitializer
 *
 * Reads the start of an array and allocates storage for it, placing its
 * size in out_count. A number of objects follow equal to the element count
 * of the array. You must call @ref mpack_done_array() when done (even
 * if the element count is zero.)
 *
 * If an error occurs, NULL is returned and the reader is placed in an
 * error state.
 *
 * If the count is zero, NULL is returned. This does not indicate error.
 * You should not check the return value for NULL to check for errors; only
 * check the reader&apos;s error state.
 *
 * The allocated array must be freed with MPACK_FREE() (or simply free()
 * if MPack&apos;s allocator hasn&apos;t been customized.)
 *
 * @throws mpack_error_type if the value is not an array or if its size is
 * greater than max_count.
