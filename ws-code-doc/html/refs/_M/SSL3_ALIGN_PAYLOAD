  * Some will argue that this increases memory footprint, but it&apos;s not
  * actually true. Point is that malloc has to return at least 64-bit aligned
  * pointers, meaning that allocating 5 bytes wastes 3 bytes in either case.
  * Suggested pre-gaping simply moves these wasted bytes from the end of
  * allocated region to its front, but makes data payload aligned, which
  * improves performance:-)
