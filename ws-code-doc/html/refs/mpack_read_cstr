 * Reads bytes from a string, ensures that the string contains no NUL
 * bytes, copies the bytes into the given buffer and adds a null-terminator.
 *
 * A string must have been opened by a call to mpack_read_tag() which
 * yielded a string, or by a call to an expect function such as
 * mpack_expect_str().
 *
 * The given byte count must match the size of the string as returned
 * by the tag or expect function. The string will only be copied if
 * the buffer is large enough to store it.
 *
 * If an error occurs, the buffer will contain an empty string.
 *
 * @note If you know the object will be a string before reading it,
 * it is highly recommended to use mpack_expect_cstr() instead.
 * Alternatively you could use mpack_peek_tag() and call
 * mpack_expect_cstr() if it&apos;s a string.
 *
 * @throws mpack_error_too_big if the string plus null-terminator is larger than the given buffer size
 * @throws mpack_error_type if the string contains a null byte.
