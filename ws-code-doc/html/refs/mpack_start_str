 * Opens a string. `count` bytes should be written with calls to
 * mpack_write_bytes(), and mpack_finish_str() should be called
 * when done.
 *
 * To write an entire string at once, use mpack_write_str() or
 * mpack_write_cstr() instead.
 *
 * MPack does not care about the underlying encoding, but UTF-8 is highly
 * recommended, especially for compatibility with JSON.
