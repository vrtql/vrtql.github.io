 * Sets a |callback| that is invoked upon receipt of ServerHelloDone to validate
 * the received SCTs.
 * If the callback returns a non-positive result, the connection is terminated.
 * Call this function before beginning a handshake.
 * If a NULL |callback| is provided, SCT validation is disabled.
 * |arg| is arbitrary userdata that will be passed to the callback whenever it
 * is invoked. Ownership of |arg| remains with the caller.
 *
 * NOTE: A side-effect of setting a CT callback is that an OCSP stapled response
 *       will be requested.
