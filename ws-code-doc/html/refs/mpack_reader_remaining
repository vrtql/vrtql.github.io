 * Returns bytes left in the reader&apos;s buffer.
 *
 * If you are done reading MessagePack data but there is other interesting data
 * following it, the reader may have buffered too much data. The number of bytes
 * remaining in the buffer and a pointer to the position of those bytes can be
 * queried here.
 *
 * If you know the length of the MPack chunk beforehand, it&apos;s better to instead
 * have your fill function limit the data it reads so that the reader does not
 * have extra data. In this case you can simply check that this returns zero.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the reader is in an error state.
 *
 * @param reader The MPack reader from which to query remaining data.
 * @param data [out] A pointer to the remaining data, or NULL.
 * @return The number of bytes remaining in the buffer.
