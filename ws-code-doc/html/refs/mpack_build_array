<doc f='codebrowser/src/mpack/mpack-writer.h' l='763'>/**
 * Starts building an array.
 *
 * Elements must follow, and mpack_complete_array() must be called when done. The
 * number of elements is determined automatically.
 *
 * If you know ahead of time the number of elements in the array, it is more
 * efficient to call mpack_start_array() instead, even if you are already
 * within another open build.
 *
 * Builder containers can be nested within normal (known size) containers and
 * vice versa. You can call mpack_build_array(), then mpack_start_array()
 * inside it, then mpack_build_array() inside that, and so forth.
 *
 * @see mpack_complete_array() to complete this array
 * @see mpack_start_array() if you already know the size of the array
 * @see mpack_build_map() for implementation details
