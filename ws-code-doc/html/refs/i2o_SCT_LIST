 * Serialize (to TLS format) a stack of SCTs and return the length.
 * &quot;a&quot; must not be NULL.
 * If &quot;pp&quot; is NULL, just return the length of what would have been serialized.
 * If &quot;pp&quot; is not NULL and &quot;*pp&quot; is null, function will allocate a new pointer
 * for data that caller is responsible for freeing (only if function returns
 * successfully).
 * If &quot;pp&quot; is NULL and &quot;*pp&quot; is not NULL, caller is responsible for ensuring
 * that &quot;*pp&quot; is large enough to accept all of the serialized data.
 * Returns &lt; 0 on error, &gt;= 0 indicating bytes written (or would have been)
 * on success.
