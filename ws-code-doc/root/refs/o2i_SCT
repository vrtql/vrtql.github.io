 * Parses an SCT in TLS format and returns it.
 * If |psct| is not null, it will end up pointing to the parsed SCT. If it
 * already points to a non-null pointer, the pointer will be free&apos;d.
 * |in| should be a pointer to a string containing the TLS-format SCT.
 * |in| will be advanced to the end of the SCT if parsing succeeds.
 * |len| should be the length of the SCT in |in|.
 * Returns NULL if an error occurs.
 * If the SCT is an unsupported version, only the SCT&apos;s &apos;sct&apos; and &apos;sct_len&apos;
 * fields will be populated (with |in| and |len| respectively).
