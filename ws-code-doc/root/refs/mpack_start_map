 * Opens a map.
 *
 * `count * 2` elements must follow, and mpack_finish_map() must be called
 * when done.
 *
 * If you do not know the number of elements to be written ahead of time, call
 * mpack_build_map() instead.
 *
 * Remember that while map elements in MessagePack are implicitly ordered,
 * they are not ordered in JSON. If you need elements to be read back
 * in the order they are written, consider use an array instead.
 *
 * @see mpack_finish_map()
 * @see mpack_build_map() to count the number of key/value pairs automatically
