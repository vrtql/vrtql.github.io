 * Writes a portion of bytes for a string, binary blob or extension type which
 * was opened by mpack_write_tag() or one of the mpack_start_*() functions.
 *
 * This can be called multiple times to write the data in chunks, as long as
 * the total amount of bytes written matches the count given when the compound
 * type was started.
 *
 * The corresponding mpack_finish_*() function must be called when done.
 *
 * To write an entire string, binary blob or extension type at
 * once, use one of the mpack_write_*() functions instead.
