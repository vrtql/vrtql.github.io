 * Writes a null-terminated string. (The null-terminator is not written.)
 *
 * MPack does not care about the underlying encoding, but UTF-8 is highly
 * recommended, especially for compatibility with JSON. You should consider
 * calling mpack_write_utf8_cstr() instead, especially if you will be reading
 * it back as UTF-8.
 *
 * You should not call mpack_finish_str() after calling this; this
 * performs both start and finish.
