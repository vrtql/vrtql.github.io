 * @brief Represents a worker thread context
 *
 * Thread Context. Worker threads can carry a user-defined context which they
 * pass to process_message() handlers. They call a factory method to create this
 * context. Upon exit, they likewise call a factory method to destruct it.
 *
 * This context acts as a lifelong state within the worker_thread which provides
 * tasks with additional resources to do their job. This context is ideal for
 * maintaining state across tasks like database connections.
