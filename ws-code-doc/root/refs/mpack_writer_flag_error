 * Places the writer in the given error state, calling the error callback if one
 * is set.
 *
 * This allows you to externally flag errors, for example if you are validating
 * data as you write it, or if you want to cancel writing in the middle of a
 * document. (The writer will assert if you try to destroy it without error and
 * with unclosed compound types. In this case you should flag mpack_error_data
 * before destroying it.)
 *
 * If the writer is already in an error state, this call is ignored and no
 * error callback is called.
