 * @brief Adds a new item to the address pool.
 *
 * This function adds a new item to the address pool. If the pool is full, it is
 * resized. The function searches for the first free slot to use, starting from
 * the last used index and wrapping around if necessary.
 *
 * @param pool A pointer to the address pool.
 * @param address The uintptr_t item to be added to the pool.
 * @return int The index at which the item was added, or -1 if resizing failed.
