     binary compatibility with static initializers.

     Concurrency notes:
     The __kind of a mutex is initialized either by the static
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER or by a call to pthread_mutex_init.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the __kind of a mutex is usually not
     changed.  BUT it can be set to -1 in pthread_mutex_destroy or elision can
     be enabled.  This is done concurrently in the pthread_mutex_*lock functions
     by using the macro FORCE_ELISION. This macro is only defined for
     architectures which supports lock elision.

     For elision, there are the flags PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP and
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP which can be set in addition to the already set
     type of a mutex.
     Before a mutex is initialized, only PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP can be set
     with pthread_mutexattr_settype.
     After a mutex has been initialized, the functions pthread_mutex_*lock can
     enable elision - if the mutex-type and the machine supports it - by setting
     the flag PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP. This is done concurrently. Afterwards
     the lock / unlock functions are using specific elision code-paths.  */</doc>
