 * Serialize (to TLS format) an |sct| and write it to |out|.
 * If |out| is null, no SCT will be output but the length will still be returned.
 * If |out| points to a null pointer, a string will be allocated to hold the
 * TLS-format SCT. It is the responsibility of the caller to free it.
 * If |out| points to an allocated string, the TLS-format SCT will be written
 * to it.
 * The length of the SCT in TLS format will be returned.
