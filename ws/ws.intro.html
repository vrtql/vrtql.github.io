library written in C. It provides a simple yet flexible API for building
WebSocket clients and servers. It supports all standard WebSocket features
including text and binary messages, ping/pong frames, control frames and
includes built-in OpenSSL support.</p><p>The motivation behind the project is to have a portable WebSockets client
library under a permissive license (MIT) which feels like a traditional socket
API (blocking with optional timeout) which can also provide a foundation for
some additional messaging features similar to (but lighter weight than) AMQP and
MQTT.</p><p>The code compiles and runs on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OS X,
Illumos/Solaris and Windows. It is fully commented and well-documented.
Furthermore, the code is under a permissive license (MIT) allowing its use in
commercial (closed-source) applications. The build system (CMake) includes
built-in support to for cross-compiling from Linux/BSD to Windows, provided
MinGW compiler and tools are installed on the host system. Instructions on
cross-compiling are covered in <a class="xref" href="ws.build.html#ws.build.windows" title="3.2. Cross Compiling">Section 3.2, “Cross Compiling”</a>.</p><p>There are two parts to the library: a client-side component and an
optional server-side component. The library was initially written for
client-side only. The server component was added shortly after the client code
was completed. The two components are built from completely different networking
designs, each suited to their particular use-cases. The client architecture is
designed for single connections and operates synchronously, waiting for
responses from the server. The server architecture is designed for many
concurrent connections and operates asynchronously.</p><p>The client-side API is simple and flexible. Connections wait (block) for
responses and can employ a timeout in which to take action if a response does
not arrive in a timely manner (or at all). The API is threadsafe in so far as
each connection must be maintained in its own thread. All global structures and
common services (error-reporting and tracing) use thread-local variables. The
API runs atop the native operating system’s networking facilities, using
<code class="function">poll()</code> and thus no additional libraries are
required.</p><p>The server-side API implements a non-blocking, multiplexing, multithreaded
server atop <code class="filename"><a class="link" href="https://libuv.org/" target="_top">libuv</a></code>. The server consists of
a main networking thread and a pool of worker threads that process the data. The
networking thread runs the <code class="filename">libuv</code> loop to handle socket I/O
and evenly distributes incoming data to the worker threads via a synchronized
queue. The worker threads process the data and optionally send back replies via
a separate queue. The server takes care of all the WebSocket protocol
serialization and communication between the the network and worker
threads. Developers only need to focus on the actual message processing logic to
service incoming messages.</p><p>The requirement of <code class="filename">libuv</code> is what makes the server
component optional. While <code class="filename">libuv</code> runs on every major
operating system, it is not expected to be a requirement of this library, as its
original intent was to provide client-side connections only. Thus if you want
use the server-side API, you simple add a configuration switch at build time to
include the code (covered in <a class="xref" href="ws.build.html" title="3. Building and Installing">Section 3, “Building and Installing”</a>).</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer" class="navtable"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ws.preface.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ws.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ws.intro.ws.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Foreward </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="ws.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 2. WebSocket Overview</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
